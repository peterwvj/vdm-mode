;;; Commentary:
;;
;; vdm-mode currently supports the following features:

;; - Syntax highlighting and editing
;; - Replacement of ASCII syntax (e.g. lambda) with more aesthetically
;;   looking symbols (e.g. λ) using prettify-symbols-mode
;; - On the fly syntax checking using Flycheck
;; - VDM YASnippets
;; - REPL (read–eval–print loop) support based on comint
;; - Integration with VDMJ and Overture

  "Create cons to make the command `prettify-symbols-mode' replace FROM with TO.

Each character of TO is vertically aligned using the baseline,
such that base-left of the character is aligned with base-right
of the preceding character.  The resulting composition for a TO
value of \"abc\" is (?a (Br . Bl) ?b (Br . Bl) ?c) where the
composition rule (Br . Bl) between each pair of characters says
that the base-right of the first character will be aligned with
the base-left of the second character. Refer to
`reference-point-alist' for more information.
